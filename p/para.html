        <summary>Global warming</summary>
        <p>n common usage, climate change describes global warming—the ongoing 
            increase in global <b>average temperature—and its effects on Earth's 
            climate system. Climate change in a broader </b>sense also includes previous 
            long-term <del> to Earth's climate. The current rise in global average</del> 
            temperature is primarily<strong> caused by humans burning fossil fuels since the 
            Industrial Revolution.[3][4] </strong>Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural
            the heat that the Earth radiates after <i>it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere.</i> 
            Carbon dioxide,<em> the primary greenhouse gas driving global warming,</em> has grown by about 50% and 
            is at levels unseen for millions of years.[6]

            Climate <mark>change has an increasingly large impact on the environment</mark>
            Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming 
            more common.[7] <small>Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to </small>thawing permafrost, retreat
            of glaciers and sea ice decline.<ins>[8] Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, 
            and other weather extremes.[9] Rapid environmental change in mountains</ins>, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many 
            species to relocate or become extinct.[10] Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, 
            some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.[11]</p>
